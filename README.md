In Asteroid Field, the player controls a ship that spawns in the centre of the screen.

The aim of the game is to avoid asteroids that spawn at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom.

Asteroids that reach the bottom convert into points.

If the player hits an asteroid, the ship gains 3 seconds of immunity and one of three lives is lost. 

When all three lives are lost, the end game screen is shown where the final score is displayed.
